## Project idea

This is a simple platformer game. At a level, you control a green character. Your goal is to eat as many red characters as possible and reach the yellow door. Every red character is worth 10 points. There are three levels with increasing complexity. Level completion and scores are stored between game sessions. 

## Instructions

In the homepage, press the "Levels" button to go to the level selection screen. In the level selection screen, you can see 3 cards representing level 1 to 3. Each card has a button to go to the level, and a small text below. The text should say "Not completed" if the corresponding level has not been completed. 

NB: If you play on a mobile device and wish to play in landscape mode, **turn your phone** at this screen before going to the levels. Some controls are rendered incorrectly if you try to switch orientation during the level.

Click on a button to open a level. You should see the level map at this point. Size of the game should be adjusted based on the screen size. 

If you are using keyboard:
- Press "A" to move left
- Press "D" to move right
- Press space to jump

If you are using touch screen:
- Use the joystick on the left side of the screen to move
- Press the arrow up button on the right side of the screen to jump

After you collect points and reach the yellow door, the result screen should appear. It should tell you how many score you got. There's a button that takes you back to the level selection screen.
